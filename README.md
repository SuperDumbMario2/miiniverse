# Miiniverse
A miiverse clone with least features and IP auth. Unrelated to the one that I teased on my server an MVClonapedia Discord. (This is not Minverse or Miniverse)
# WARNING
This is not a very high-quality code. I am still learning PHP and made it just as a side project, please do not tell me this is bad. Also this is fully procedural code so if you're not a fan of procedural code you will not like this code.

# How to install
Upload the entrie repo to the root of your server.

After this create a db and import the "miiniverse.sql" file.

Then, set up the dbconnect.php file to connect to your DB.

If you done all steps correctly you now have a instance of Miiniverse!

Please note there is no administrative functions yet so you have to use PHPMyAdmin for now.
